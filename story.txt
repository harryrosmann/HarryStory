Once upon a time, Buckingham Badger was on his way from the Dejope class to his first class of the day. He had to walk all the way down Bascom Hill to get to the Humanities Building. Unfortunately, it had rained the day before and froze overnight. The sidewalk on Bascom Hill was covered with a thick coat of slippery ice! 

Buckingham Badger luckily brought his handy dandy sled-shoes. He went right down the sidewalk with no problem at all.As he got to the bottom he turned around and saw that everyone was slipping and falling down. He then thought back towhat his best friend Deb told him about helping others out so he tossed his shoes up to help the next person down. Deb's advice was a real life sver

Little did Buckingham Badger know, one of his peers, Yung Gravy, suffers from a chronic illness called "DontFall-itis", meaning that if he falls, he may persish. Buckingham Badger's sled shoes gave Yung Gravy the ability to survive another day on his way to state street. He was eternally gratefull to Buckingham Badger and Deb. 

All was going well, until the chain was broken. Someone fumbled the sled shoes! And with the crazy winds the shoes flew all the way to the Union, on to the frozen Lake Mendota. What would Bucky do now?
