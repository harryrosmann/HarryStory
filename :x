Once upon a time, Buckingham Badger was on his way from the Dejope class to his first class of the day. He had to walk all the way down Bascom Hill to get to the Humanities Building. Unfortunately, it had rained the day before and froze overnight. The sidewalk on Bascom Hill was covered with a thick coat of slippery ice!
